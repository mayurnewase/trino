Directories

lib
    Contains the Java archives (JARs) that make up the Trino server and all required
    dependencies.
plugins
    Contains the Trino plug-ins and their dependencies, in separate directories for
    each plug-in. Trino includes many plug-ins by default, and third-party plug-ins
    can be added as well. Trino allows for pluggable components to integrate with
    Trino, such as connectors, functions, and security access controls.
bin
    Contains launch scripts for Trino. These scripts are used to start, stop, restart,
kill, and get the status of a running Trino process. Learn more about the use of
these scripts in “Launcher” on page 83.

etc -> testing/trino-server-dev/etc
    This is the configuration directory. It is created by the user and provides the
necessary configuration files needed by Trino. You can find out more about the
configuration in “Configuration Details” on page 79.

var
    Finally, this is a data directory, the place where logs are stored. It is created the
first time the Trino server is launched. By default, it is located in the installation
directory. We recommend configuring it outside the installation directory to
allow for the data to be preserved across upgrades.

----

Concepts

connector:
    Adapts Trino to a data source. Every catalog is associated with a specific
connector.

Catalog:
    Defines details for accessing a data source; contains schemas and configures a
specific connector to use.

Schema:
    A way to organize tables. A catalog and schema together define a set of tables that
can be queried.

Table:
    A set of unordered rows, which are organized into named columns with data
types.


-----

Connector Arch: SPI (Service Provider Interface)
    defines the functionality a connector has to implement for specific features.
    
    Trino connectors are plug-ins loaded by each server at startup. They are configured
        by specific parameters in the catalog properties files and loaded from the plug-ins
        directory

    ref: core/trino-spi/src/main/java/io/trino/spi/connector/Connector.java

    it should implement
        Operations to fetch table/view/schema metadata
        
        Operations to produce logical units of data partitioning, so that Trino can paral‐
            lelize reads and writes
        
        Data sources and sinks that convert the source data to/from the in-memory
            format expected by the query engine

    SPI mainly includes
        medatadata SPI: used by by co-ordinator
            used by coord to get info about tables, cols, types
            used to validate the query.

        data statistics SPI: used by by co-ordinator
            used by coord to get row counts and table sizes for cost based optimization on the query

        data location SPI: used by by co-ordinator
            used to create distributed query plan
            and generate logical splits of table contents.

        data stream SPI: used by by source tasks
            to fetch data from data source using connector
            then passed to trino in form of pages

-------

Catalogs, Schemas, and Tables
    connector 1:1 catalog
    catalog 1:many schemas
    schemas 1: many tables

    Each catalog configuration uses a connector to access a specific data
    source. The data source exposes one or more schemas in the catalog. Each schema
    contains tables that provide the data in table rows, with columns using different data
   
--------
Query execution model
    ref: trino/core/trino-main/src/main/java/io/trino/sql/planner/QueryPlanner.java

    steps:
        coordinator receives text query from CLI or JDBC/ODBC drivers or client libs
        parses it
        analyze it
        plans and optimize it
        triggers workers to get data from sources
        create result data set
        make it available to client



    query planner's core components are:
        Analysis
        Session 
        Plan node allocator
        planner context
        relation plan
        subqueryplanner

    hierararchy and splits of the query as below
        datasource is upstream
        user is downstream

        query plan converted to distributed query plan
        distributed query plan defines the stages and the way to execute those on workers
        stage consists of tasks
        each task processes a piece of data is called split
        split is descriptor of underlying data that can be retieved and processed by worker
            it is unit of parallelism and work assignment.

        coord assigns tasks to workers

        pages:
            tasks at the source stage prodce data called pages
                which are collection of rows in columnar format
                pages flow to next downstream stages using exchange operators
                exchange operators read data from task within an upstream stage

        exchange operators:
            operator process data and give output to downstream operator
            operator examples are tables scans, filters, joins, aggregations. 


        pipeline:
            sequence of exchange operators in a task is called pipeline
            last opertor of pipeline puts its output in task output buffer
            so exchange operator of downstream task consume the op output buffer of upstream task
            this happens parallally

        driver:
            after task is created it instantiates a driver for each split
            so each driver is instantiation of pipeline of operators and performs processing of data in the split
            task may contain multiple drivers, so once all drivers are finished data is passed to next task.
                and drivers and tasks are destroyed

Query planning

    example query
        SELECT
            (SELECT name FROM region r WHERE regionkey = n.regionkey) AS region_name,
            n.name AS nation_name,
            sum(totalprice) orders_sum
        FROM nation n, orders o, customer c
        WHERE n.nationkey = c.nationkey
        AND c.custkey = o.custkey
        GROUP BY n.nationkey, regionkey, n.name
        ORDER BY orders_sum DESC
        LIMIT 5;

    simplest query plan
        - Limit[5]
            - Sort[orders_sum DESC]
                - LateralJoin[2]
                - Aggregate[by nationkey...; orders_sum := sum(totalprice)]
                    - Filter[c.nationkey = n.nationkey AND c.custkey = o.custkey]
                    - CrossJoin
                        - CrossJoin
                            - TableScan[nation]
                            - TableScan[orders]
                        - TableScan[customer]
                - EnforceSingleRow[region_name := r.name]
                    - Filter[r.regionkey = n.regionkey]
                        - TableScan[region]

    program that produces the result
    query planner and optimizer participate to generate the plan

    plan is tree, execution starts from leaf node procededs up the structure

Optimization rules

    optimizer which uses below tricks is called syntactic optimizer
    because it only considers the query syntax

    1. Predicate Pushdown:
        move filtering conditions closer to the source of data
        transforms Filter in simple filter and inner join into cross join
        
        - Aggregate[by nationkey...; orders_sum := sum(totalprice)]
            - Filter[c.nationkey = n.nationkey]  // transformed simpler filter
                - InnerJoin[o.custkey = c.custkey]  // added inner join
                    - CrossJoin
                        - TableScan[nation]
                        - TableScan[orders]
                    - TableScan[customer]

        it couldn't improve cross join between nation and order as there was no immediate condition joiining these tables
        so next optimization comes into play

    2. Cross Join Elimination:
        in absense of cost based optimizer, trino joins table in select query in the order it appears in the query text
        with 1 exception, if there is no join condition then it results in cross join
        in almost all cases cross join is unwanted

        this optimization eliminates the crossjoin by reordering the tables being joined to minimize the number of cross joins
        if relative table sizes info is not present, other than cross join elimination table join order is preserved.


        - Aggregate[by nationkey...; orders_sum := sum(totalprice)]
            - InnerJoin[c.custkey = o.custkey]   // reordered to custkey first
                - InnerJoin[n.nationkey = c.nationkey] // then nationkey
                    - TableScan[nation]
                    - TableScan[customer]
                - TableScan[orders]

    3. Top N:
        limit clause is always preceded by order clause, without it SQL doesn't guarantee the rows returned
        trino could sort all rows produced and then just retain the first few of them according to limit clause
        but its not optimal, so it instead it uses TopN node plan
        which during query execution keeps desired number of rows in head data structure
        and keep it updating while reading the input data in a streaming fashion

    4. Partial Aggregations:
        trino in the above query doesn't need to pass all rows from order table to join
        because we not into all orders, just an aggregate sum of totalprice for each nation
        so this optimization reduce the data flowing into downstream join by aggregating it.
        results are not complete so this is called partial aggregations

        - Aggregate[by nationkey...; orders_sum := sum(totalprice)]
            - InnerJoin[c.custkey = o.custkey]
                - InnerJoin[n.nationkey = c.nationkey]
                    - TableScan[nation]
                    - TableScan[customer]
                - Aggregate[by custkey; totalprice := sum(totalprice)]
                    - TableScan[orders]



    5. lateral join deorrelation:
        trino decorrelates the subquery into normal left join
        so query
            SELECT
                (SELECT name FROM region r WHERE regionkey = n.regionkey)
                AS region_name,
            n.name AS nation_name
            FROM nation n

        changes into
            SELECT
                r.name AS region_name,
                n.name AS nation_name
            FROM nation n LEFT OUTER JOIN region r ON r.regionkey = n.regionkey

        but first query fails if there are duplicate entries in region table
        second doesn't, so this needs additional check like numbering all source rows and if any duplicate is found fail the query
        as original

        - TopN[5; orders_sum DESC]
            - MarkDistinct & Check
                - LeftJoin[n.regionkey = r.regionkey]
                    - AssignUniqueId
                    - Aggregate[by nationkey...; orders_sum := sum(totalprice)]
                    - ...
                - TableScan[region]


---------
Cost based optimizer

    Cost: CPU time + Memory requirements + network bandwidth

    syntactic optimizer only considers query syntax to generate query plan
    cost based optimizer ensures multiple variants of same query produce same
        optimal query plan for trino-engine to process


    exmaple query:
        SELECT
            n.name AS nation_name,
            avg(extendedprice) as avg_price
        FROM nation n, orders o, customer c, lineitem l
        WHERE  n.nationkey = c.nationkey
            AND c.custkey = o.custkey
            AND o.orderkey = l.orderkey
        GROUP BY n.nationkey, n.name
        ORDER BY nation_name;
           
    now above optimizer will generate below plan for it

        - Aggregate[by nationkey...; orders_sum := sum(totalprice)]
            - InnerJoin[o.orderkey = l.orderkey]
                - InnerJoin[c.custkey = o.custkey]
                    - InnerJoin[n.nationkey = c.nationkey]
                        - TableScan[nation]
                        - TableScan[customer]
                    - TableScan[orders]
                - TableScan[lineitem]
           
    now if just change the order of conditions in where clause this plan will also change
    and will also affect query performance which isn't ideal


    Optimizers involved:
        1. cost of the join: while joining tables with "=" condition, trino implements 
            extended version of algo called "hash join"
            it uses 3 level hashing to parallelize processing

        2 table statistics: gets table info from the connector for data sources
            and determine optimal ordering of the tables in the query.

        3. filter statistics: 
        4. table statistics for partitioned tables: 
        5. join enumeration: 
        6. broadcast vs distributed joins:


--------

Checking table statistics:
    
    trino gives "analyze" command to collect stats for a connector, and stores in a hive metastore
    
    syntax is 
        >> "analyze table_name [with (property_name = expression [,...])]"
    
    example:
        >> analyze datalake.ontime.flights;

display table statistics:
    >> "show stats for datalake.ontime.flights"


------

Connectors:
    connector takes the processed query from trino and gives it to the data source and get results
    and passes it back to trino.

    to configure add a catalog in etc/catalog/ which needs a connector name
    sometimes connector can directly push down the entire query to the datasource
    but it has few limits
    e.g in postgresql connector for query
        
        select state, count(*) from airport where country=US group state;
        
        connector pushes down this query
            select state from airport where country=us;

            and does the aggregation on Trino to take advantage of distributed compute which postgresql doesn't have

        if you wanna push down entire queries to the postgresql, create view on postgresql and its exposed to trino as a table
        then trino pushes down whole query.


    Iceberg connector is very feature rich, so check that out.

-------

Query Federation

    use fully qualified name for sources like
        catalog + schema + table name


----- 
    Sql in Trino: not needed for now
        includes function and operators
        lambda, aggregate functions
        geospatial functions and prepared statements
